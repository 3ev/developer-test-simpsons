I ended up running out of time to do CHANGE #1 as I spent too long with the issue #3

I have never tried caching but I would save the data received on the first load to a json file
and load that in and after a specific timeframe do another api call and then save that data.

Then when the user filters an item when that gets implemented I would call the api again then just
to receive the most up to date results.
